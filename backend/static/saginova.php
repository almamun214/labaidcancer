                         The SagiNova® HDR afterloader was designed to address today´s needs for HDR brachytherapy applications regarding safety, seamless workflows, and cost efficiency.
SagiNova® version 2.1 is the latest update, adding editable test plans for quicker QA plan management, user-defined dwell position offsets for more individual quality control measures, editable user role names, user-defined audio feedback for various system statuses, an integrated source decay table and a source dongle to speed up source exchanges. 
Due to the considerably longer half-life of five years and a certified 100,000 source transfers, we have chosen the Co-60 source as it requires time to perform QA procedures related to source exchanges only every five years. 
The highly customizable tool QAssist supports physicists by defining and running site specific quality assurance protocols. Guiding the performance of these protocols, QAssist ensures streamlined and well documented quality assurance.
By choosing an applicator in SagiPlan®, the length of the applicator and the overall length of the application are digitally transferred to the afterloader without requiring any manual input. Hence, the afterloader is able to validate the correct overall length per channel prior to each source movement. The ultimate benefits of the Automatic Length Measurement are improved patient safety and peace of mind for clinicians when treating body sites such as head & neck, breast, and skin with flexible catheters or breast balloons.
